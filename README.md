   - Verify API keys in `.env` file
   - Check Coresignal API quota/limits
   - Try broader search terms

3. **Import errors**:
   - Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Check Python version compatibility

### Performance Tips
- Use specific queries for better results
- Combine main query with refinements for precision
- Export large result sets for offline analysis
